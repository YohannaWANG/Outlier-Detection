# Toward Universal Law of Outlier Propagation
We argue that Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) admits a principled way to quantify outliers in terms of so-called randomness deficiency. For the probability distribution generated by a causal Bayesian network, we show that the randomness deficiency of the joint state decomposes into randomness deficiencies of each causal mechanism, subject to the Independence of Mechanisms Principle. Accordingly, anomalous joint observations can be quantitatively attributed to their root causes, i.e., the mechanisms that behaved anomalously. As an extension of Levin's law of randomness conservation, we show that weak outliers cannot cause strong ones when Independence of Mechanisms holds. We show how these information theoretic laws provide a better understanding of the behaviour of outliers defined with respect to existing scores.
